# ΛTLΛS VR: Master Plan

## Vision
To build a unified Spatial Computing Engine ("ΛTLΛS") that powers three distinct research demonstrations for the ΛTHENΛ project. The goal is to secure internal sponsorship by visualizing Knowledge (Mnemosyne), Logic (Themis), and Design (Tecton).

## Core Philosophy
1. **Human-Centric:** AI proposes, Human decides.
2. **Spatial Logic:** Data has mass, physics, and coordinates.
3. **Unified Engine:** One codebase (Atlas Engine) powers all three domains.

## The Three Modalities
1. **Mnemosyne (Knowledge Space):** 3D Force Graph for PKM.
   - *Goal:* Visualize research clusters and AI suggestions.
2. **Themis (Agent Council):** CPN Visualization.
   - *Goal:* Visualize multi-agent workflow states and checkpoints.
3. **Tecton (CellCAD):** Parametric Configurator.
   - *Goal:* Real-time trade-off visualization (Mass vs. Thermal).

## Hardware & Deployment
- **Target Device:** Meta Quest 3.
- **Role of ΛTLΛS:** A core engine providing VR experiences for existing Desktop applications.
- **Supported Apps:**
    - **ATHENA:** Knowledge & Logic.
    - **CellCAD:** Engineering Design.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] WebXR performance > 72 FPS on Quest 3.
- [ ] Labels readable at arm's length.
- [ ] "Green Line" trust mechanic clearly understood by testers.
